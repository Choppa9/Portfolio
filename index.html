            <h1>Hello I'm <span>Herman</span></h1>

            <p>I am an undergraduate student who's in my
                5th semester in Binus University. I am currently
                streaming on Applied Database. I have skills in
                Oracle Database, SQL, Java and C Programming, as
                well as UI/UX creation using Figma. My experience in
                Binus University has brought me a significant
                amount of knowledge, allowing me to proficiently
                use my skills as well as improving my
                communication, critical and creative thinking skills.

            <p>I am an undergraduate student who's in my 5th semester in Binus University. I am currently streaming on Applied Database. I have skills in Oracle Database, SQL, Java and C Programming, as well as UI/UX creation using Figma. 

                Throughout my experience in Binus University, I have learned a significant amount of knowledge related to the skills that I currently have. I am able to proficiently use SQL and Oracle Database to create a functioning database based on the various business cases or scenarios that have been given to me. I am also able to proficiently use Java and C, as well as creating and designing an interactable user interface with Figma.
                
                Other than that, my experience in Binus University have also improved my soft skills, such as creative and critical thinking, as well as my communication skills. 
                
                I am always trying to learning and accumulate more knowledge that I believe might be useful to me in the future, whether they are knowledge that are related to my current skills or whether they are new things that I have yet to discover.</p>

                After conducting an interview and finding out the problem that the store faces, we designed 
                the logical and physical data model using Oracle Data Modeler Application, complete with data inside.</p>
